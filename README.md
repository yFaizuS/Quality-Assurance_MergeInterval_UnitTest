# Quality Assurance Merge Interval
this is a repository for Quality Assurance Testing Assignments, for the Assignment I got assigned the task to Merge Intervals

# Assignment 1 - Unit Tests
It is required to take a ready solution of an assigned task from https://neetcode.io/practice (searchable by section + name of task) and cover this solution by unit-tests, using testing techniques and task text, using unit-testing tools (libraries and so on) available for your platform. Publish the solution code, tests and all other artifacts in the git repository. 
## The Problem 
The problem is called Merge Interval here are the details :

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. 


**Example 1:**

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].




**Example 2:**

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output: [[1,5]]

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

 

**Constraints:**

1 <= intervals.length <= 104

intervals[i].length == 2

0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
